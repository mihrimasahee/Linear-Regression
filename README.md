# Linear-Regression
Linear Regression is one of the simplest and most widely used supervised machine learning algorithms. It is used for predicting a *continuous target variable (dependent variable) based on one or more input features (independent variables)*. The goal is to find the best-fitting straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that minimizes the difference between the predicted and actual values.

## Equation of a Line:
- The relationship between the dependent and independent variables is modeled using a linear equation:
- **y=mx+c**
- y: Dependent variable (target).
- x: Independent variable (feature).
- m: Slope (coefficient of x)
- c: Intercept.

## Objective:
Find the best values for m (slope) and c (intercept) such that the line fits the data points as closely as possible.

## Cost Function:

The cost function (e.g., Mean Squared Error) measures how far the predicted values are from the actual values. The goal is to minimize this cost function.

## Gradient Descent:

An optimization algorithm used to adjust the values of m and c to minimize the cost function.

### Types of Linear Regression
#### Simple Linear Regression:
Only one independent variable is used to predict the target.
- y=mx+c.

#### Multiple Linear Regression:

Multiple independent variables are used to predict the target.
- y=m1x1+m2x2+...+mnxn+c
