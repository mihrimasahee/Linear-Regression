# Linear-Regression
Linear Regression is one of the simplest and most widely used supervised machine learning algorithms. It is used for predicting a *continuous target variable (dependent variable) based on one or more input features (independent variables)*. The goal is to find the best-fitting straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that minimizes the difference between the predicted and actual values.

## Equation of a Line:
The relationship between the dependent and independent variables is modeled using a linear equation:
**y=mx+c**
y: Dependent variable (target).
x: Independent variable (feature).
m: Slope (coefficient of x)
c: Intercept.
