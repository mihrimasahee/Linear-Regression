# Linear-Regression
Linear Regression is one of the simplest and most widely used supervised machine learning algorithms. It is used for predicting a *continuous target variable (dependent variable) based on one or more input features (independent variables)*. The goal is to find the best-fitting straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that minimizes the difference between the predicted and actual values.
